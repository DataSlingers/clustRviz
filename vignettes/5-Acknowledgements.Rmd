The computational core of `clustRviz` is written in standard modern `C++` [@CppStandard:11],
using the `Eigen3` library for numerical linear algebra [@Eigen3] and the `Rcpp` [@Eddelbuettel:2011]
and `RcppEigen` [@Bates:2013] libraries to interface with `R` [@R].

The graphical components of `clustRviz` depend on several publicly available `R` packages, including:

- the `dendextend` package [@Galili:2015] which is used for dendrogram construction and manipulation;
- the `ggplot2` [@Wickham:2016] and `gganimate` [@Pedersen:2019] packages which are used for path visualizations;
- the `plotly` [@Sievert:2020] package which is used for interactive dendrograms and path plots; and 
- the `heatmaply` [@Galili:2018] package which is used for export of interactive cluster heatmaps based on `CARP` and `CBASS` results

We are grateful to the authors of each of these packages for making their software freely available.
