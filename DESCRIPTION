Description: Fast computation and interactive for the convex clustering and 
             bi-clustering problems. The CARP and CBASS algorithms use an 
             algorithmic regularization scheme to obtain high-quality global 
             approximations of the exact regularization paths in a fraction of
             the time required for exact solutions. The CARP-VIZ and CBASS-VIZ
             variants include a back-tracking scheme to ensure exact dendrogram
             recovery. For more details, see "Dynamic Visualization and Fast Computation
             for Convex Clustering and Bi-Clustering" by M. Weylandt, J. Nagorski, and G.I. Allen, 
             ArXiv 1901.01477 <arXiv:1901.01477>.
